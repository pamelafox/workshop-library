# Make Web Apps with Python

## Goals

In this workshop, you'll learn how to build web apps using the two most popular Python web app frameworks, Flask and Django, and then learn how to integrate a database into apps. After creating an app in each framework, you'll also learn about deployment strategies and actually deploy your apps to Azure.

Prerequisites: Attendees should have previous Python programming experience. No web app experience required, however. Attendees can either use their local computer for development (which will require Python and some additional downloads) or use Github Codespaces (which requires a Github account).

## Prerequisites

- Skills
  - Intermediate Python: Decorators, Object-oriented programming
- Software
  - [Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/python-install-vscode/?WT.mc_id=python-79461-pamelafox)
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com??WT.mc_id=python-79461-pamelafox)

## What students will learn

This workshop starts off with a high-level introduction of web apps, including an explanation of HTTP. Students then learn about Flask, and try to modify the templates of a Flask app to add more functionality. The workshop then introduces databases, showing how they can be integrated into Flask (via SQL-Alchemy) and then into Django (with its native ORM).
Students then get a Django app running, try out the Django admin, and make a change to the app's Django models.

Students should walk away from the workshop with an understanding of the common features of web app backends (routes, templates, models)
and the key differences between the Flask and Django frameworks

## Workshop flow

The times given below are estimates. Students may want to spend more time on the exercises or have more questions during the lecture components,
so we recommend allocating 2 hours for this workshop.

* [10m] (Slides) How the web works
* [15m] (Slides) Server-side Python
* [15m] (Exercise 1) Flask app
* [15m] (Slides) Adding Databases
* [15m] (Exercise 3) Django app
* [15m] (Slides) Hosting web apps
* [15m] (Exercise 3) Deploying an app
* Q&A

## Next steps

- [Create data-driven websites by using the Python framework Django](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/django-create-data-driven-websites/?WT.mc_id=python-79461-pamelafox)

## Practice

With your first project created you can begin to further explore Django. You can see how to [create models](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/django-models-data/?WT.mc_id=python-79461-pamelafox), [modify data with the admin site](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/django-admin-site/?WT.mc_id=python-79461-pamelafox), and [use views and templates to display data](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/django-views-templates/?WT.mc_id=python-79461-pamelafox).
